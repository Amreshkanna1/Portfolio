                        <h4>Hi Folks , Let you know who am I here. </h4>
                        <p> 
                         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       I'm a <span>Modern Civilian</span> with old fashioned soul, which is bounded to live to learn , learn to experiement, 
                        experiment to succeed. As a matter of fact, Doing something is not enough , when you can do something big which you never 
                        had done or thought of it. It takes a piece of interest to learn , experiment and implement. Finally, you made it 
                        and there is no need of applauds for it because nature rewards you for creation, patience , dedication.  
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  I'm a <span>Soul of fire</span> with lot of dreams but restrained by situations, enivornment and people. Dreams are not dreams
                        when you can see them in real world where you're the pioneer of every step which made them come true. Each dream 
                        has it's own roots to dawn to achieve it, well , you're the owner of your dreams , everything is in you and I feel, 
                        you can build it by burning thyself with focus and work.
                       </p>
                       <p>                   
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  I'm a <span>Lucid Dreamer</span>, I plunge into my dreams and explore to create things. Indeed, dreaming is important because 
                        you can see out of your vision to envision the big picture which satiates your soul. If you're unable to imagine 
                        how something going to work / will be ? then you're  blind.I visualize my thoughts which paves a way where i need 
                        to travel to gratify my journey as a human being.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm a <span>Nature Lover</span>, each artifact found in world are from mother nature. Inspirations are born from nature's
                        ecosystem. Indeed, the best lesson we can learn from nature is , " If you want to survive in this world, learn
                        to be different, embrace the things how they are! , nothing is wasted when you know how to use it, Learn to be
                        amorphous, just relax there are tremendous lessons. 
                       </p>
                       <h5>Well,  those are my soul words, Let's talk now about who am I ?</h5>
                       <p>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  I'm a <span> passionate self-taught Designer / Developer</span>. Merely, my quest commenced from scratch so I have had to learn 
                        everything from roots. Even though ,I'm not good at maths, but I follow 3 main formulas in my journey: <span>
                         3D's (Desire , Dedication , Determination) , 3C's 
                        (chances, choices, change ) , IPDE (Identify,Predict,Decide,Execute)</span>. Actually , I got them from reading books.
                        Of course, I love to read books, which makes me confident and gives some potential knowledge , such that I can stay
                        calm myself. Hey reader of my story !! now , you got an idea , I'm a Deep thinker. Yes , you're right. I spend my time to
                        think and draw out conclusions, from it i can learn something new. Why to waste the time in front of a machine to know about 
                        me. Let's meet and discuss.
