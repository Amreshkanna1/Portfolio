                                  <h2>In Search of Soul</h2>
                                  <p> As a matter of fact, the people are concerned with hypothetical approach in defining something.
                                        Despite of it , you can only see through your naked eyes is a biological or materialistic matter.</p>
                                       
                                       <p> When it comes to soul, a blend of various learnings, observations, thoughts and imagination etc. 
                                       Probably, how you train your soul, is one which elevates your perception towards the things.
                                        Even though, soul is just an illusion and intangible matter. At the end of the day
                                        you need to answer thyself for every action carried out whether is inbound or out of soul.</p>

                                       <p>Merely, the definition of the soul is a water which can be fitted in any shape and never stable. 
                                       Soul is an air travels in any direction and you can't see but you can sense it. 
                                       Soul is a fire which has a power of destruction but it depends on how you use it.</p>
                                       
                                       <p>Lastly, your soul is bounded to intuition and how you want to travel either in light or darkness. 
                                       Indeed, knowledge is a fuel for your soul. So keep learning and account your experience.</p>

                                  <h2>Soul Cry</h2>
                                  <p>Here I go through -- As of being a soul in human, 
                                    I am not concerned with the things which are carried out by my mate. 
                                    I'm just a concealed innate and not sure whether mate follows my guidelines to accomplish 
                                    the quest towards joy and success. </p>
                                    
                                    <p> Perhaps , we commence our quest of being in him for now. 
                                    There is an inevitable conflict of thoughts when determining the things . 
                                    I'm on my virtue to show the right path to lead a fruitful life but mate 
                                    slams me with bizarre thoughts to attain the things which are temporary in nature. </p>
                                    
                                    <p> Inevitably, things becomes subtle to figure out which are real and fake.
                                     Probably the journey is interim and forgot to satiate with right choices 
                                    rather than choosing the snares blindly laid by wicked humans. To be honest, 
                                    Mate backstabbing himself with his deeds and desires and loosing his identity as a human. 
                                    I need to stay calm while he is doing all those things because I'm not possessed with materialistic
                                     things or fake relationships. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>At the end of the life of my mate , I will fly to my next mate before that ,
                                     I'm crying deep inside without unheard voice , screaming hard , bleeding continuously,
                                     loosing hope and being lost. Searching for unanswered questions which hooked up me with pang. 
                                    Indeed, why I'm experiencing all these because </p>
                                    
                                    <blockquote>

                                    <p>Yes, you heard right . I'm the soul of you, no one can see me except thyself.
                                     I'm the one who is being a victim of every game played outside the world by you.

                                     when you are down to do something? I'm not physical to be destroyed but a feel to be expressed 
                                    when you are self-aware about thyself.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>As a soul my message is leave this love on artificial world, unmask your 
                                    species start living in nature . Indeed, embrace the nature and make the most of
